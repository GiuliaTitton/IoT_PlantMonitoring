# IoT_PlantMonitoring
This project aims to monitor a plant station using various hardware components and software tools. The system collects, processes, and displays data from the plant station to provide insights and ensure optimal plant health.
## Overview
The Plant Station Monitoring System utilizes a combination of hardware and software to monitor environmental parameters of a plant station. The main components include:
- Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC)
- Nucleo STM32
- AD7606 Analog-to-Digital Converter
- Raspberry Pi (serving as a gateway)

Data collected from the sensors is processed and displayed using the following software tools:
- Node-RED for data flow orchestration
- InfluxDB for time-series data storage
- Grafana for data visualization
